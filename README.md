# Soft-Repeat

![Logo](media/Soft%20Repeat%20Logo.png)

An extension that lets you repeat between two custom points in a YouTube video, softly interpolating the volume inbetween.

To use, open a YouTube video, right-click, and press loop as you normally would. Afterwards, the extension will appear under the video.

The supported format for specifying time is `hour:min:sec`, with hours and minutes being optional. If no timepoint is specified, it will default to the start or end of the video.
